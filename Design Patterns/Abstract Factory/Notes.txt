Classification of patterns:
---------------------------

Good quote: "You can make an intersection safer by either installing some traffic lights or building an entire mult0level interchange with underground passages for pedestrians".

The general pattern categories:
- Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code: Meaning: They provide a way for you to create objects that make them more flexible without duplicating code.

- Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
